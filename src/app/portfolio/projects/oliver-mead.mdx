## Background

**Oliver Mead** is an innovative company that provides bespoke solutions to businesses across the globe. We are dedicated to working together with uncompromising ethics and integrity and we provide an array of services at any level.

I was responsible for the product design and UX/UI experience for the website.

I have listed some key achievements below:

1. **Implemented several user flows.**
This has helped our team establish more structure to how we conduct our work and allow other team members to easily understand the design.

2. **Establishing a design kit.**
This has helped to maintain consistency in the look and feel across different parts of the platform.

3. **Establishing a design system.**
This has helped the Engineering and Product teams to understand how and why we choose to implement certain components over others.

## Conclusion

The above project was a very easy and straightforward project but of course, we will still effect some changes sooner or later as we deem fit.

Some things I learnt from this project are:

1. **Big challenges require small steps.**
Take small steps, because big changes cannot be brought overnight.

2. **No idea is irrelevant.**
No matter where the idea is coming from, I think it would be best to put it into consideration first and it might just be the best decision we made.
