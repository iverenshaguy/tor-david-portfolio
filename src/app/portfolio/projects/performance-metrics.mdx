## Background

**The Performance Metric** is a web app that was created to help keep track of our work output as individuals. It is used to estimate how well every member of the team has been contributing to a particular project and if we are all keeping to time so we can deliver our project(s).

I was responsible for the product design and UX/UI experience for the web app, working closely with the senior UI/UX Designer in the company.

I have listed some key achievements below:

1. **Implemented several user flows.**
This has helped our team establish more structure to how we conduct our work and allow other teams to easily understand the design.

2. **Establishing a design kit.**
This has helped to maintain consistency in the look and feel across different parts of the platform.

3. **Establishing a design system.**
This has helped the Engineering and Product teams to understand how and why we choose to implement certain components over others.

## Conclusion

This project was a quick yet enjoyable project to design. It is very easy to understand and it proved to be very useful to the company.

Some things I learnt from this project are:

1. **The best designs come from collaboration.**
It was inspiring to see how each person was able to bring to the table a different perspective during the brainstorming sessions.

2. **Focus on the problem.**
At the end of the day, it is your usersâ€™ pains that you will be creating a solution for. So keeping that in mind is important as it's easy to lose sight of this and focus on beautification.
