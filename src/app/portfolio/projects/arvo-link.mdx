## Background

**Arvolink** is a simple yet beautiful application that was created to help users disburse funds with little to no stress involved. The app calculates your funds and disburses them exactly the way you choose to.

I was responsible for the product design and UX/UI experience for the website.

I have listed some key achievements below:

1. **Implemented several user flows.**
This has helped our team establish more structure to how we conduct our work and allow other teams to easily understand the design.

2. **Establishing a design kit.**
This has helped to maintain consistency in the look and feel across different parts of the platform.

3. **Establishing a design system.**
This has helped the Engineering and Product teams to understand how and why we choose to implement certain components over others.

## Conclusion

The above project was a very easy yet beautiful project that I am very proud to be a part of.

Some things I learnt from this project are:

1. **Big challenges require small steps.**
Take small steps, because big changes cannot be brought about overnight.

2. **Don’t worry too much about decorating the design.**
Earlier in my journey, I made the mistake of worrying about the look of the UI. Taking a step back and reassessing the user flows helped me to reprioritize the UX.

3. **Focus on the problem.**
At the end of the day, it is your users’ pains that you will be creating a solution for. So keeping that in mind is important.
