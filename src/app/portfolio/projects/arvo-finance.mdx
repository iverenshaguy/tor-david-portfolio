## Background

**Arvo Finance** is a Nigeria-based Fintech company that aims to provide users with easy access to loans and an entirely more enjoyable online banking experience for users.

I joined Oliver Mead as a product design intern on the first of June, 2022. There was only one designer in the company and I assisted him actively with everything. I supported design across every aspect of our business.

I grew tremendously during this period, some key achievements of which I have listed below:

1. **Implemented several user flows.**
This helped our team establish more structure to how we conduct our work and help every member of the team to easily understand the design.

2. **Improved usability across the platform.**
No usability tests were conducted by the external consultancy before dev handoff. Since we established a design team, we have been actively conducting UX research and usability tests to improve usability on all platforms.

3. **Establishing a design kit.**
This helped to maintain consistency in the look and feel across different parts of the platform.

4. **Establishing a design system.**
This helped the Engineering and Product teams to understand how and why we choose to implement certain components over others.

## Conclusion

Since the implementation of the upgrade, there has been a noticeable increase in the use of the mobile app and web app by users because now it feels and behaves like a real mobile bank. Users also appreciate how easy it is to use the app.

Some things I learnt from this project are:

1. **User testing doesnâ€™t end after development.**
Design is a constant iteration of improving the experience for the end user. Always find ways to collect and listen to your user's feedback.

2. **Involve engineering upfront.**
This helps to reduce any extra work later on as an understanding of the technical limitations upfront will help to inform your design strategy.
